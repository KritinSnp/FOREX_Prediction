## Master's degree disseration 

The aim of the project is to compare the three foreign exchange rate prediction by different analytic models as following:

1. Apply statistical methods, such as hypothesis test and data distribution, to examine the actual exchange rate data before modelling
2. Implement Random Walk model
3. Implement ARIMA model
4. Implement LSTM model
5. Evaluation by rolling window of training data
6. Compare the strength and weakness of each model
7. Report the whole process as Dissertation.pdf created by LaTeX

**Key library:** Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Keras, Arch
